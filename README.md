## Web App for Frame Interpolation and Visualization of Satellite Data.
This project is for Smart India Hackathon (Under Development) and is designed to process satellite imagery by fetching data from MOSDACâ€™s INSAT-3DR and generating smooth time-lapse videos through frame interpolation techniques. The interactive map provides an intuitive way to view and overlay satellite data for a more detailed analysis of atmospheric conditions.

### Key Features:

    Satellite image frame interpolation for smoother time-lapses.
    Interactive map interface with multiple data layers.
    Video generation and export with FFmpeg.

### Technologies:
    React
    Leaflet
    MOSDAC (INSAT-3DR)
    Python
    FFmpeg
    FILM (Frame Interpolation)
